We've introduced an innovative approach to elevate this process and enrich developers' insights. Utilizing a dataset containing chapter leaders, assistant managers, and developers, our application now suggests and notifies the most suitable individuals for a given merge request. This not only streamlines the review process but also fosters cross-functional knowledge transfer, allowing anyone within the vertical to contribute. Consequently, best practices and new implementations become widely known, enhancing the overall coding environment.

When initiating a Merge Request on GitLab, there's an option to designate the reviewer for the request. Currently, the default setting assigns reviewers randomly. However, based on our exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset, we've identified that the Merge Request benefits from a more targeted review by someone with expertise in the field, as it has shown improved accuracy in such cases.
